Hi! I'm Keshav Singh, a PhD candidate in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at Tohoku University Japan under the supervision of Prof. Kentaro Inui. 
My research interests include argumentation mining, developing computational models that mimic human reasoning, and data creation and analysis. 

I'm also a keen learner of novel research practices in NLP domain and its consumer directed usage. This includes its deployment in search engines (e.g., google) or in investing (e.g., price forcasting). 

In addition to research, I often enjoy local food, Japanese sake, onsen and weekend trips to natural scenic spots to have some fun break time.
